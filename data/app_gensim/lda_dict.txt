However, there are several important practical aspects of training LTR models that one needs to know in order to bring the business impact through changes in LTR algorithms. There is also a limit in capabilities of these algorithms. In practice a combination of LTR algorithms and some heuristic rules are used to typically bring business impact. In this talk, I will discuss important lessons of training LTR models for real applications and will also speak about some specific issues that needs to be addressed in e-commerce or employee and job search platforms.\n\nIsabelle Guyon, President at ChaLearn\n\nBio:\n\n&nbsp;Isabelle Guyon is an independent consultant, specialized in statistical data analysis, pattern recognition and machine learning.

These networks are not just descriptive of the \u201cState of Nature\u201d, they allow us to make predictions such as forecasting disruptive weather patterns, evaluating the possible effect of a drug, locating the focus of a neural seizure, and predicting the propagation of epidemics. This, in turns, allows us to device adequate interventions or change in policies to obtain desired outcomes: evacuate people before a region is hit by a hurricane, administer treatment, vaccinate, etc. But knowing the network structure is a prerequisite, and this structure may be very hard and costly to obtain with traditional means. For example, the medical community relies on clinical trials, which cost millions of dollars; the neuroscience community engages in connection tracing with election microscopy, which take years before establishing the connectivity of 100 neurons (the brain contains billions). This presentation will review recent progresses that have been made in network reconstruction methods based solely on observational data. Great advances have been recently made using machine learning. We will analyze the results of several challenges we organized, which point us to new simple and practical methodologies.\n\nJeremy Stanley, EVP/Data Scientist, Sailthru\n\nBio:\n\n&nbsp;Chief Data Scientist &amp; EVP of Engineering Prior to Sailthru, Jeremy was the CTO at Collective where he led a team of data scientists, product managers and engineers in creating technology platforms that used machine learning and big data to solve digital advertising challenges.

In this talk, I will focus on the engineering side and discuss some of the practical lessons we\u2019ve learned from years of developing the machine learning systems that power Netflix. I will go over what it takes to get machine learning working in a real-life feedback loop with our users and how that imposes different requirements and a different focus than doing machine learning only within a lab environment. This involves lessons around challenges such as where to place algorithmic components, how to handle distribution and parallelism, what kinds of modularity are useful, how to support both production experimentation, and how to test machine learning systems.\n\nSubutai&nbsp;Ahmad, VP of Research, &nbsp;Numenta\n\nSubutai&nbsp;Ahmad is the VP of Research at Numenta, a company focused on Machine Intelligence.

Abstract:\n\nReal-time Anomaly Detection for Real-time Data Needs\n\nSummary:\n\nMuch of the world\u2019s data is becoming streaming, time-series data, where anomalies give significant information in often-critical situations. Examples abound in domains such as finance, IT, security, medical, and energy. Yet detecting anomalies in streaming data is a difficult task, requiring detectors to process data in real-time, not batches, and learn while simultaneously making predictions. Are there algorithms up for the challenge? Which are the most capable? The Numenta Anomaly Detection Benchmark (NAB) attempts to provide a controlled and repeatable environment of open-source tools to test and measure anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. The perfect detector would detect all anomalies as soon as possible, trigger no false alarms, work with real-world time-series data across a variety of domains, and automatically adapt to changing statistics. These characteristics are formalized in NAB, using a custom scoring algorithm to evaluate the detectors on a benchmark dataset with labeled, real-world time-series data. We present these components, and describe the end-to-end scoring process. We give results and analyses for several algorithms to illustrate NAB in action. The goal for NAB is to provide a standard, open-source framework for which we can compare and evaluate different algorithms for detecting anomalies in streaming data.\n\nJoe Reisinger, CTO and Co-Founder, Premise\n\nBio:\n\n&nbsp;Joe Reisinger is an engineer exploring the intersection of econometrics and machine learning.

However, the recent proliferation of internet-enabled smartphones, with users spanning from globe from Mississippi to Mozambique, combined with the rise of crowdsourcing platforms, has paved the way for bottom-up data collection and citizen-journalism at an unprecedented scale. In this talk, Joe will outline three challenges when trying to orchestrate the collective actions of crowds and present some practical machine learning-based solutions: (1) how to optimize task allocation under a constrained budget in order to maximize the quality of collected data; (2) how to balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining a consistent sampling design; (3) how to mitigate the effects of fraud and coalition formation.\n\nTed Dunning, Chief Application Architect, MapR\n\nBio:\n\n&nbsp;Ted Dunning is Chief Application Architect at MapR and has held Chief Scientist positions at Veoh Networks, ID Analytics and at MusicMatch, (now Yahoo Music).
